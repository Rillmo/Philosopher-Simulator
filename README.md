## Dining-Philosophers problem
> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dining_philosophers_problem

## Description
This simulator was created to better understand the problem of eating philosophers. <br/>
It shows every sequences that philosphers eating, taking a fork, sleeping and thinking. <br/>
In real problems, more than one philosopher is prohibited from picking up a fork at the same time.<br/>
But in the simulator, two forks are placed between each philosopher to also show the case of picking up two forks. <br/>
So if more than one philosopher picks up a fork as a result of simulator, it might be considered to be against the principle of mutual exclusion.<br/>

## How to use
1. Check number of philosophers that you want to simulate. (maximum 10 philosophers recommanded <- the limit of the circumference of a circle)
2. Press "Generate Philo Elements" button to generate philosopers and forks.
3. Enter the execution result of your philosopher problem, and press the start button.
4. You'll see your philosophers eating, thinking, holding a fork, sleeping at a certain point.
5. There are pause buttons and play buttons for ease of use.
